    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a transcendental experience, provided that you of course make it right! They can be notoriously difficult to make, but thank your lucky stars because I'm here to guide you. </p>
    <p>Just follow this step-by-step instructions and surely you will experience heaven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the meat sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. 
        It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
            Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li>
        <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
            Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
            Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce</li>
        <li>Boil and drain the pasta sheets</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna and plate it!</li>
    </ol>
